# Grocery expense data analyse and visualisation

This project analyse and visualise your monthly grocery expense with your bank statement (CSV format)

The rising grocery prices in New Zealand would prompt one to be aware of one's grocery expense.

These codes read the transaction code in your bank statement from all 3 major supermarkets in New Zealand. 
Namely, Countdown, Pak'n Save and New World. 
PS: If you shop at other places for grocery, you can modify the code where it reads the supermarkets' names.

These codes calculates your average (mean value) monthly grocery expense and visualise it in a bar chart.
The codes marks the bars in a deeper shade of green if that month exceeds the mean value.

Be aware of thy grocery expense, cut thy food waste.
