##This project analyse and visualise your monthly grocery expense with your bank statement (CSV format)

###The rising grocery prices in New Zealand would prompt one to be aware of one's grocery expenses.
These codes read the transaction code in your bank statement from all 3 major supermarkets in New Zealand. 
Namely, Countdown, Pak'n Save and New World.

It calculates your average (mean value) monthly grocery expense and visualise it in a bar chart.
It marks the bars in a deeper shade of green if that month exceeds the mean value.

Be aware of thy grocery expense, cut thy food waste.
